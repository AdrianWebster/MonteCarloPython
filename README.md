TVN	is	a	television	station	that	has	25	thirty-second	advertising	slots	during	each	evening.	
The	station	is	now	selling	advertising	 for	the	 first	 few	days	in	October.	They	could	sell	all	
the	slots	now	 for	$4,000	each,	but	because	on	October	6 there	will	be an	important	sport	
event,	the	station	may	be	able	to	sell	slots	to	sport	brands	at	the	last	minute	for	a	price	of	
$10,000	 each.	 For	 now,	 assume	 that	 a	 slot	 not	 sold	 in	 advance	 and	 not	 sold	 at	 the	 last	
minute	is	worthless	to	TVN
